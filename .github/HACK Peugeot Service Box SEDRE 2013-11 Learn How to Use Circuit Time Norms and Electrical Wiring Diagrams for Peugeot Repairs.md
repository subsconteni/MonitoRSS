## SQL Injection Examples and How to Prevent Them
 
SQL injection is a technique where SQL commands are executed from the form input fields or URL query parameters. This leads to unauthorized access to the database (a type of hacking). SQL injection can have serious consequences, such as data theft, data corruption, or even server compromise. In this article, we will look at some common SQL injection examples and how to prevent them.
 
### Example 1: SQL Injection Using Multiple Statement
 
Suppose we have a search form to search products by their ID on our website. The PHP code snippet to search product would look something like:

    $prod_id = $_GET ["prod_id"];
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = " . $prod_id;

Let's take a look if user submits 20, how SQL is interpreted:

    SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 20

Nothing suspicious, right? What if user inputs 20; DROP TABLE Products;? Let's take a look at SQL statement again:

    SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 20; DROP TABLE Products;

Now this SQL statement also deletes the Products table from the database based on input data. This was possible because most database systems can execute multiple statements at the same time[^2^].
 
### Example 2: SQL Injection Using Always True Condition
 
Another way to perform SQL injection is by passing a condition that always results in TRUE so that the data is always fetched no matter what. Let's take a look at another PHP code snippet where we have a login form in our website and we need to fetch users by providing credentials.

    $username = $_POST ["username"];
    $password = $_POST ["password"];
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = \"" . $username . "\" AND password = \"" . $password . "\"";

If user inputs username as root and password as pass, the SQL will interpret:

    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = "root" AND password = "pass"

This code snippet looks fine when user inputs correct username and password. What if the user inputs username as invalid\_user" OR "1"="1 and password as invalid\_pass" OR "1"="1? Let's take a look at how SQL interprets.

    SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = "invalid_user" OR "1"="1" AND password = "invalid_pass" OR "1"="1"

Since, "1"="1" is always true, no matter what the username and password user enters, SQL will fetch all the users from the database[^2^].
 
### How to Protect SQL Statements From Injections?
 
The best way to protect SQL statements from injections is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These are special types of SQL queries that separate the structure of the query from the user input data. This way, the user input data is treated as literal values and not as part of the SQL command. Most programming languages and frameworks support parameterized queries or prepared statements. For example, in PHP, you can use PDO (PHP Data Objects) or mysqli (MySQL Improved) extensions to create parameterized queries. Here is an example of using PDO:

    $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydb", "user", "pass");
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
    $result = $stmt->fetchAll();

In this example, the question marks (?) are placeholders for the user input data. The execute() method binds the user input data to the placeholders and executes the query safely. The user input data is never interpreted as part of the SQL command[^3^].
