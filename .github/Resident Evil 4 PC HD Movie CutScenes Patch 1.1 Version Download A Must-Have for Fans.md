## Step 2: Install the patch
  
After you have extracted the patch files, you will need to copy them to your Resident Evil 4 installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files\Capcom\Resident Evil 4, but it might vary depending on your system.
  
Paste the files and overwrite any existing ones. You might want to backup your original files before doing this, just in case something goes wrong.
  
## Step 3: Configure the game
  
Before you launch the game, you will need to configure some settings to make sure the patch works properly. You can do this by editing the config.ini file located in your Resident Evil 4 installation folder.
  
Open the file with a text editor like Notepad and change the following lines:

    [MOVIE]
    MovieUse=0
    MovieSkip=0
    MovieQuality=0
    MovieSize=0

to:

    [MOVIE]
    MovieUse=1
    MovieSkip=0
    MovieQuality=3
    MovieSize=3

This will enable the HD movies and cut-scenes and set them to the highest quality and size.
  
If you are using the turbo patch, you will also need to change this line:

    [MOVIE]
    MovieTurbo=0

to:

    [MOVIE]
    MovieTurbo=1

This will enable the turbo mode for faster loading times.
  
If you encounter any crashes or errors after installing the patch, you might need to install a codec pack or a different media player to play the HD movies and cut-scenes. You can find some configuration help here:
